	The program loads input integers X and Y into the general purpose registers and executes a series of ALU arithmetic and bitwise operations where the results are saved in their corresponding memory locations. Legal inputs are integers with no displayed output in the LC3 Console and side effects to error are floating point numbers as inputs.

	To use this program, enter different values for X and Y and notice the computations being carried out through each specified LC-3 instruction. Verify the arithmetic and bitwise operations being performed by checking the contents of locations x3100 through x3018.
